# AstroTOAST
Astrodynamics TOols to ASsist in Trajectory design

This package contains tools to propagate, target, and analyze trajectories in
multibody regimes. For now AstroTOAST only has capabilities in the Circular
Restricted Three Body Problem (CR3BP), but new dynamical models such as
ephemeris can and will be added in the future.

## Usage
```julia
using AstroTOAST
```
